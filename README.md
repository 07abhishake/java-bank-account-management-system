# ATM-like Bank Account Manager App

### A Java object-oriented (OOP) console application, which will take a user's account ID and corresponding secure 4-digit Pin number (stored as a hash (MD5)), in order to authenticate and successfully login. Once logged in users can view their account summaries, get a full transactions history, as well as withdraw, deposit and transfer funds between the user's open accounts.
